 I = 5V / (RA + RB)
### Question 1: Assume RA and RB both equal 10000 Ω. What are the total resistance and total current in the circuit?
RA = 10000; RB = 10000;
5V / 20000 = I;
I = 0.00025

Answer
Total resistance is 20000 Ω
Total current is 0.00025

### Question 2: Assume RA = 10000 Ω and RB = 5000 Ω. What are the total resistance and total current in the circuit?
RA + RB = 10000 + 5000;
RA +RB = 15000;
I = 5V / (RA + RB)
5V / 15000 = 0.0003333...;

answer
Total resistnace is 15000 Ω;
Total current is 0.0003333...


For each resistor, V = I ⨉ R. So VA = I ⨉ RA and VB = I ⨉ RB.

### Question 3: Assume RA = 10000 Ω and RB = 5000 Ω. How much voltage is lost through resistor RA? And RB?
RA + RB = 10000 + 5000 = 15000;
I = 5V / 15000 = 0.00033;
VA = I * RA; VA = 0.00033 * 10000;
VA = 3.3;
VB = I * RB; VB = 0.00033 * 5000;
VB = 1.65;

answer
3.3V lost through RA;
1.65V lost through RB;
