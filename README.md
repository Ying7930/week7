 I = 5V / (RA + RB)
### Question 1: Assume RA and RB both equal 10000 Ω. What are the total resistance and total current in the circuit?
RA = 10000; RB = 10000;
5V / 20000 = I;
I = 4000

Answer
Total resistance is 20000 Ω
Total current is 4000

### Question 2: Assume RA = 10000 Ω and RB = 5000 Ω. What are the total resistance and total current in the circuit?
RA + RB = 10000 + 5000;
RA +RB = 15000;
I = 5V / (RA + RB)
5V / 15000 = 3000;

answer
Total resistnace is 15000 Ω;
Total current is 3000


For each resistor, V = I ⨉ R. So VA = I ⨉ RA and VB = I ⨉ RB.

### Question 3: Assume RA = 10000 Ω and RB = 5000 Ω. How much voltage is lost through resistor RA? And RB?
RA + RB = 10000 + 5000 = 15000;
I = 5V / 15000 = 3000;
VA = I * RA; VA = 3000 * 10000;
VA = 30000000;
VB = I * RB; VB = 3000 * 5000;
VB = 15000000;
VA + VB = 5V
3000000 + 15000000 = 5V;
5V = 18000000;
